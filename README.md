# Description
This is a gambling bot for discord, with the currency being *world locks*, there is no automatic deposit in the source, however there is handling for webhook messages. How it worked was there was a growtopia client running with an injected cheat known as `GrowPai`, that was running a lua script to check for any deposit logs and report them to the discord server where the bot would handle it. Other than that this is a pretty simple source with a decently sorted database (can definitely be improved).
